# Appendix C: Links and Resources

Navigating the regulatory landscape of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) requires more than just a theoretical understanding of the law; it requires access to the right tools, portals, and official channels. In a "digital-first" nation driven by Vision 2030, the interface between a tech company and the government is almost entirely electronic.

This appendix serves as your "Digital Directory." It consolidates the essential links, platforms, and contact points discussed throughout "The Legal Compass for Tech Companies in Saudi Arabia." Whether you are a founder looking to register a *Commercial Register (Sijil Tijari)* or a Data Protection Officer (DPO) seeking the latest guidelines on cross-border data transfer, this chapter provides the direct route to compliance.

## 2. Official Government Platforms

In Saudi Arabia, "The Platform is the Law." Most regulatory actions are not done via paper but through specific digital portals. Familiarizing yourself with these is the first step toward operational excellence.

### The "Big Three" for Setup
1.  **MISA (Ministry of Investment):** If you are a foreign entity, this is your first stop. You apply for your *Investment License* here.
    *   **Portal:** [investsaudi.sa](https://investsaudi.sa)
2.  **Ministry of Commerce (MC):** Used for issuing the *Commercial Register (Sijil Tijari)* and reserving trade names.
    *   **Portal:** [mc.gov.sa](https://mc.gov.sa)
3.  **Mudad & Qiwa:** These are the essential platforms for HR and payroll.
    *   **Qiwa:** Handles employment contracts and *Saudization (Nitaqat)* quotas.
    *   **Mudad:** Handles the *Wage Protection System (WPS)*.
    *   **Portal:** [qiwa.sa](https://qiwa.sa) | [mudad.com.sa](https://mudad.com.sa)

### Tech and Data Oversight
*   **SDAIA (Saudi Data and AI Authority):** The regulator for PDPL and AI ethics.
    *   **Portal:** [sdaia.gov.sa](https://sdaia.gov.sa)
*   **CST (Communications, Space and Technology Commission):** If your tech involves telecommunications, VoIP, or cloud hosting, you must register here.
    *   **Portal:** [cst.gov.sa](https://cst.gov.sa)
*   **NCA (National Cybersecurity Authority):** For companies working on critical infrastructure or government projects.
    *   **Portal:** [nca.gov.sa](https://nca.gov.sa)

### Financial and Tax
*   **ZATCA (Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority):** For VAT registration and the mandatory *E-invoicing (Fatoora)* system.
    *   **Portal:** [zatca.gov.sa](https://zatca.gov.sa)

    *   **Portal:** [sama.gov.sa](https://sama.gov.sa)

> **Practical Tip: The "Absher Business" Account**
> Every tech founder must have a premium *Absher Business* account linked to their *Establishment Number (Raqm Al-Munsha'ah)*. This is the "Master Key" for all government transactions, from renewing expat visas to authorizing legal representatives.

## 3. Important Contacts

When automated portals aren't enough, reaching out to the right department can save months of delay.

### For Foreign Investors
*   **MISA Investor Care Center:**

    *   **Website:** [monshaat.gov.sa](https://monshaat.gov.sa)

## 4. Resources for Continuous Learning

The Saudi tech market moves faster than almost any other in the region. Regulations are updated frequently to keep pace with global standards like GDPR and the EU AI Act.

### Regulatory Sandboxes (The "Safe Zone")
If your tech product is disruptive and doesn't fit existing laws, you should apply for a Sandbox. This allows you to test your product under a relaxed regulatory environment.
*   **SAMA Fintech Sandbox:** For payment processors, digital banks, and insurtech.
*   **CST IT Sandbox:** For emerging technologies like IoT, space-tech, and decentralized networks.
*   **CMA Fintech Lab:** For capital market-related tech (equity crowdfunding, robo-advisors).

### Official News and Updates
*   **Saudi Gazette & Arab News:** For English-language summaries of new Royal Decrees.
*   **The National Center for Archives and Records (NCAR):** The most reliable source for the full text of laws. [ncar.gov.sa](https://ncar.gov.sa)
*   **Wajiz:** A government platform that provides simplified summaries of Saudi laws.

## 5. Practical Tips and Common Pitfalls

### The "Activity Code" Trap
When registering your company on the *Sijil Tijari*, you must select codes from the **ISIC4 (International Standard Industrial Classification)**.
*   **Common Mistake:** Choosing a "General Trading" code when you are actually a "SaaS" provider.
*   **Consequence:** You may be barred from bidding on specialized government tech tenders or unable to register with the CST for cloud services.
*   **Solution:** Consult the [General Authority for Statistics (GASTAT)](https://stats.gov.sa) for the official Saudi version of ISIC4 codes before filing.

### The "Saudization" (Nitaqat) Calculation
*   **Warning:** Tech companies often forget that their *Nitaqat* color (Platinum, Green, Yellow, Red) fluctuates based on the total headcount.
*   **Actionable Tip:** Use the **Qiwa Nitaqat Calculator** monthly. If you fall into "Yellow," you lose the ability to issue new work visas for foreign developers immediately.

### E-Invoicing (Fatoora) Compliance
*   **The Law:** As of 2023, all B2B and B2G transactions must use "Phase 2" integrated e-invoicing.
*   **Warning:** Simply sending a PDF invoice via email is no longer compliant.
*   **Solution:** Ensure your ERP or billing software is pre-certified by ZATCA. Check the [ZATCA Certified Solution Providers List](https://zatca.gov.sa).

### Data Residency
*   **The Law:** Under the PDPL and NCA controls, certain "Sensitive Data" and "Government Data" must remain on servers physically located within Saudi Arabia.
*   **Practical Example:** If you are building a HealthTech app for Saudi citizens, you cannot host the primary database on an AWS region in Europe. You must use local providers (e.g., STC Cloud, Oracle Jeddah, or Google Cloud Dammam).
